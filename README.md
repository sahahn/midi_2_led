## MIDI to Lights

Note: This is an old project from Spring 2017 uploaded as an archive. 

### Intro 

This project is designed to implement the raspberry PI as a MIDI to DMX converter. Where MIDI is a technical standard, allowing communication between audio devices and computers most generally, and DMX representing a similar standard used in lighting devices. The basic goal of the project is to provide an interface for a player of an electric keyboard (with MIDI out) the ability in real time enact lighting changes in lights capable of working with the DMX protocol. While a number of higher end lighting boards allow some interaction with sound, and a number of also interesting and similar technology exists, the primary focus of the project will be in programming the interaction to accurately represent visually the musical component.

### Directory

This directory includes the final code in workingBuild.py, a midi test script, a GUI for editting config files in configEditor.py and also some other funny odds and ends, e.g., the original project proposal, and in leiu of proper version control, just a folder filled with different versions of the code.

Give the code itself some slack, I had only taken my first intro to python class a little under a year before trying this project. Instead check out the cool videos of the final working version: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV7bcBXoSTE6RovpsHM6S3A/videos
